This project uses data science & analytics skills to collect data, explore the data, perform analysis, create visualizations, and generate insights of Nigeria COVID-19 dataset in each state, Real Domestic Gross Product and State Budget e.t.c. related to the pandemics.

## Project Overview

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Many countries across the global community, are facing unprecedented challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Nigeria and her people are no exception. According to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), the virus first appeared in Nigeria on February 29, 2020, when an Italian citizen arrived in Lagos via an airline from Milan, Italy, and proceeded to a factory in Ogun state. With 58 contacts under follow-up, the case was dubbed an index case. On March 3rd, 2020, a total of 15 suspicious cases were discovered in four Nigerian states. This was seen as the start of the disease spreading to other parts of the country, with Lagos, Ogun, the Federal Capital Territory, and Kano being listed as high-risk areas due to their populations and proximity to an international airport (except Ogun with no international airport but shares border with Lagos).
## Project Objectives
The aims and objective of this project are:

i. Applying data science and data analysis skills to scrap live data from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) Coronavirus Covid-19.

ii. Exploring the data, perform analysis, create visualizations, and generate insights using python tools like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn e.t.c.
## Data Sources
The data source is divided into different parts, and combine all the different parts of the data to perform analysis and provide insights.

i. The Nigeria Centre for Diseases Control (NCDC) monitors the country’s COVID-19 situation, and releases data on metrics across all the 37 states in the country. Data can be obtained from NCDC COVID-19  official website by performing a web extraction or web scraping. The NCDC COVID-19 contains the affected states the number of confirmed cases, number of discharged cases, number of admission cases, and number of death.

ii. The Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) publishes daily data on confirmed, death and recovered cases across different countries but we are to extract the data for Nigeria only.

iii. Real Domestic Gross Product DataThe data is used to determine the impact of COVID-19 on the economy. 

iv. State Budget Data: This data shows the effect of COVID-19 on the economy for all the States in Nigeria.

v. Nigeria Community Vulnerability Index data The vulnerability index was computed by considering several factors such as socio-economic status, population density, housing type, transportation, epidemiological, health system etc, these factors are known as themes. Each theme was broken into subthemes, and data was gathered from them to compute the overall vulnerability index score by weighing equally each theme.

## Lessons Learned

The project was fun and a lot was learnt. Many challenges were encountered In the process like some columns that were suppose to be integer but were giving in form of object and commas were present. All these were successfully cleaned.
   ## Conclusion

   It is no longer a news that COVID-19 pandemic has left no part of the world untouched. The virus emerged from Wuhan, China, and spread to all other country for example Nigeria. Base on the analysis carried out so far, COVID-19 pandemic has an enormous effect on Nigeria health, education, transportation, finance, telecommunication just to mention few. It is high time for leadership, citizens and state institutions to come together for solutions and to prevent the deadly virus from spreading.
